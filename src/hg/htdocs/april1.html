  - Going Back to Our Roots</b></font>
  <p>
  For many years, the UCSC Genome Browser has provided a dynamic, cutting-edge interface for
  viewing genomic data.  As time has gone by, however, it has become clear to us that we
  cannot keep this up.  It is not fair to you, our users, that our interface keeps changing,
  and it has increasingly been a burden on us to keep up with emerging web technologies.  Today
  that all changes, as we return you to the roots of the web: ASCII.

  <p>
  We apologize again for subjecting you to so many changes over the years, and hope that this
  new, more consistent interface will find your approval.
  <p>
  In related news, we have also revised the interface for uploading custom tracks.  Rather than
  forcing you to wrestle with inconvenient file formats for your data or attempt to set up a web server,
  we now provide the option of loading your data from a deck of ISO 6586:1980 punch cards.  Simply
  punch your data onto a deck and mail the deck to us.  Our staff of highly trained specialists
  will take care of loading track, and will inform you by mail when the process is complete.  Please
  note that our current policy of expiring unused custom tracks remains in effect; you must visit
  your track within 72 hours of the postmark date.  Regrettably, decks cannot be returned.
  <p>
  Card decks may be addressed to:<br>
  UCSC Genome Informatics Group<br>
  Center for Biomolecular Science & Engineering<br>
  CBSE, 501D Engineering II Building<br>
  University of California, Santa Cruz<br>
  1156 High Street<br>
  Santa Cruz, CA 95064
  <p>
  This new file format is also an option for data output from the <a href="/cgi-bin/hgTables">UCSC Table Browser</a>.
  Simply select "mail card deck" from the "output format" menu, and then enter your name and address on the subsequent
  page.  Please allow 4-6 weeks for delivery.
