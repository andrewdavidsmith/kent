<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #c70000;">NOTE:</span><br>VarChat is an open platform

<p>
<a href="https://varchat.engenome.com/" target="_blank">VarChat</a> is an open platform that leverages 
the power of generative artificial intelligence to support the genomic variant interpretation process 
by searching and condensing the scientific literature available for each variant into a brief yet 
informative text. Each query quickly scans the latest research to provide up-to-date variant
information.
</p>

<p>
VarChat is a generative AI-based system and each answer is generated live, so you may obtain slightly 
different answers at each iteration. A literature search will be performed and the total number of 
identified publications will be shown. Only a subset of them will be reported and used to generate your answer.
</p>

can be contacted at varchat@engenome.com.</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>

<p>
Genomic locations of variants are labeled with the nucleotide change.
Mousing over the items will show how many papers the variant was observed in, its gene,
its HGVS nomenclature and dbSNP rsID.
Clicking on any item will provide a link directly to VarChat with additional information.</p>

<p>
The items are colored based on the amount of literature support as described on the table below:
</p>

<p>
<table>
  <thead>
  <tr>
    <th style="border-bottom: 2px solid #6678B1;">Color</th>
    <th style="border-bottom: 2px solid #6678B1;">Level of literature support</th>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tr>
    <th bgcolor="#012840"></th>
    <th align="left">High: at least 25 papers mention the variant</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th bgcolor="#03738C"></th>
    <th align="left">Medium: between 10 and 24 papers mention the variant</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th bgcolor="#96D2D9"></th>
    <th align="left">Low: less than 10 papers mention the variant</th>
  </tr>

<H2>Data access</H2>
<p>
The raw data can be explored interactively with the <a href="../cgi-bin/hgTables">Table Browser</a>
or the <a href="../cgi-bin/hgIntegrator">Data Integrator</a>. The data can be accessed from scripts through our
<a href="https://api.genome.ucsc.edu">API</a>, the track name is "varChat".

<p>
For automated download and analysis, the genome annotation is stored in a bigBed file that
can be downloaded from
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/$db/bbi/" target="_blank">our download server</a>.
The file for this track is called <tt>varChat.bb</tt>. Individual
regions or the whole genome annotation can be obtained using our tool <tt>bigBedToBed</tt>
which can be compiled from the source code or downloaded as a precompiled
binary for your system. </p>
<p>
Instructions for downloading source code and binaries can be found
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#utilities_downloads">here</a>.
The tool
can also be used to obtain only features within a given range, e.g.
<br><br>
<tt>bigBedToBed http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/hg19/bbi/varChat.bb -chrom=chr21 -start=0 -end=100000000 stdout</tt></p>
