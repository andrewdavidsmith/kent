<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
These tracks contain pseudogene predictions and their parents as identified by PseudoPipe.
</p>
<h2>Display Conventions</h2>
<p>
<h3> Pseudogene track </h3>
By default pseudogenes are labeled by parent Hugo ID and type of pseudogene. The Hugo IDs are
based on the Ensembl gene IDs provided by the Gerstein lab after dataset creation; 
not all PseudoPipe IDs could be mapped back to their original Ensembl
IDs. In these cases the gene ID is listed as NA.
<br>
Pseudogenes are colored by type.
<ul>
<li><b><font color="#FF8C00">orange</font></b> - <b> unspecified pseudogene </b></li>
<li><b><font color="#0000FF">blue</font></b> - <b> processed pseudogene </b></li>
<li><b><font color="#556B2F">olive green</font></b> - <b> unprocessed pseudogene </b></li>
</ul>
<p>
Mouseover on items shows the PseudoPipe ID and Ensembl gene ID. Clicking on the gene ID
opens the parent track in that location.
</p>

<h3> Parent track </h3>
Each parent gene is shown with their pseudogenes represented as grey blocks. Each block
has a mouseover with a link to the pseudogene track.
<ul>
<li><b><font color="#800080">purple</font></b> - parent gene </b></li>
<li><b><font color="#A9A9A9">grey</font></b> - <b> pseudogene indicators </b></li>
</ul>


<h2>Data Access</h2>
The raw data can be explored interactively with the
<a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables">Table Browser</a> or the

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Annotations were filtered to remove duplicates and non standard chromosomes,
and overlapping exons merged if they belonged to the same transcript.</p>

<h2>Credits</h2>
<p> Thanks to Cristina Sisu for providing data in GTF format with parents annotated. Track 
created by Jeltje van Baren.</p>
