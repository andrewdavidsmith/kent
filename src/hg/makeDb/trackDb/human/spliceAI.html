<b>Important</b>: The SpliceAI data on the UCSC Genome Browser is directly from 
Illumina (See <a href="#dataAccess">Data Access</a> below). However, since SpliceAI refers to the
algorithm, and not the computed dataset, the data on the Broad server or other sources may have
some differences between them.
</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
SpliceAI is an <a href="https://github.com/Illumina/SpliceAI" target="_blank">open-source</a> deep
learning splicing prediction algorithm that can predict splicing alterations caused by DNA variations. 
Such variants may activate nearby cryptic splice sites, leading to abnormal transcript isoforms.
SpliceAI was developed at Illumina; a 
<a href="https://spliceailookup.broadinstitute.org" target="_blank">lookup tool</a> 
is provided by the Broad institute.
</p>
<h3>Why are some variants not scored by SpliceAI?</h3>
<p>
SpliceAI only annotates variants within genes defined by the gene
annotation file. Additionally, SpliceAI does not annotate variants if they are close to chromosome
ends (5kb on either side), deletions of length greater than twice the input parameter -D, or
inconsistent with the reference fasta file.
</p>

<h3>What are the differeneces between masked and unmasked tracks?</h3>
<p>
The unmasked tracks include splicing changes corresponding to strengthening annotated splice sites
and weakening unannotated splice sites, which are typically much less pathogenic than weakening
annotated splice sites and strengthening unannotated splice sites. The delta scores of such splicing
changes are set to 0 in the masked files. We recommend using the unmasked tracks for alternative
splicing analysis and masked tracks for variant interpretation.
</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Interpretation</h2>
<p>
Variants are colored by their predicted effects:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b><font color="#FF0000">Acceptor gain (red)</font></b> </li>
<li><b><font color="#FF8000">Acceptor loss (orange)</font></b> </li>
<li><b><font color="#0000FF">Donor gain (blue)</font></b> </li>
<li><b><font color="#D400FF">Donor loss (violet)</font></b> </li>
</ul>
</p>
Mouseover on items shows the variant, gene name, type of change (donor gain/loss, acceptor
gain/loss), location of affected cryptic splice, and spliceAI score. Clicking on any item brings up
a table with this information.
</p>
<p>
The scores range from 0 to 1 and can be interpreted as the 
probability of the variant being splice-altering. In the paper, a detailed characterization is 
provided for 0.2 (high recall), 0.5 (recommended), and 0.8 (high precision) cutoffs.</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
The data were downloaded from <a 
target="_blank" href="https://basespace.illumina.com/s/otSPW8hnhaZR">Illumina</a>. 
The spliceAI scores are represented in the VCF INFO field as 
<code style="background-color: lightgray;">SpliceAI=G|OR4F5|0.01|0.00|0.00|0.00|-32|49|-40|-31</code> <br><br>
Here, the pipe-separated fields contain 
<ul>
  <li>ALT allele</li>
  <li>Gene name</li>
  <li>Acceptor gain score</li>
  <li>Acceptor loss score</li>
  <li>Donor gain score</li>
  <li>Donor loss score</li>
  <li>Relative location of affected cryptic acceptor</li>
  <li>Relative location of affected acceptor</li>
  <li>Relative location of affected cryptic donor</li>
  <li>Relative location of affected donor</li>
</ul>
<p>
Since most of the values are 0 or almost 0, we selected only those variants 
with a score equal to or greater than 0.02.
