<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
This track shows genomic locations for variants in the
<a href="https://civicdb.org/welcome" target="_blank">CIViC (Clinical
Interpretation of Variants in Cancer) database</a>. These clinically
relevant variant interpretations are expert- and crowd-sourced from
peer-revied literature, clinical trials, and some conference
abstracts.

<p>
Each variant's interpretation is in the context of a broader molecular
profile: one or more variants grouped together. For example, clinical
evidence may be relevant to a KRAS G12 mutation on its own, but other
clinical evidence may relevant for cases with either a mutation in
KRAS G12 or G13.

<p>
The primary points of data from the scientific literature are curated
as Clinical Evidence, which connects to a molecular profile, which in
turn connects to the variants shown in this track. Groups of evidence
can become curator Assertions about the relevence of a molecular
profile.

<p>
The detail for a feature will list diseases and therapies that have
been associated with a genomic variant. Visiting the CIViC page for a
variant will allow browsing the Molecular Profiles associated with
that variant, and in turn each Molecular Profile shows the Clinical
Evidence and Assertions for various diseases and therapies.


<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>

<p>
There are three types of variant feature types in CIViC: gene, fusion, and
factor, of which only the gene and fusion fetaures have a genomic location.

<p>
Gene variants are shown as a single item, with a name indicating the
variant's mode: sequence change, gene expression, gene deletion,
etc.

<p>
Fusion variants connect two genes via a structural DNA rearrangement,
typically in the introns or promotors of genes. For CIViC fusions that
have an annotated transcript and exon, the exon will be shown as a
thick bar. If there is an intron associated with the fusion, it will
be annotated as a thin bar on the feature.

<h2>Data updates</h2>

<p>
This track reflects the monthly data summaries published by CIViC. The
latest information is always available directly on the CIViC website
or by its API.

<H2>Data access</H2>

<p>
The raw data can be explored interactively with the <a href="../cgi-bin/hgTables">Table Browser</a>
or the <a href="../cgi-bin/hgIntegrator">Data Integrator</a>. The data can be
accessed from scripts through our <a href="https://api.genome.ucsc.edu">API</a>, via the track name
&quot;civic&quot;.

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>
The monthly CIViC Variant Summaries were reformatted at UCSC
to <a href="../goldenPath/help/bigBed.html">bigBed</a> format. The
data is updated every month, the week after CIViC data summary
release. The diseases and therapies associated with a variant are
collected from the corresponding TSV files from CIViC, using the
molecular profile summaries as a mapping.

database and making the data available for download.
