<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
denovo-db (version 1.6.1) is a curated database of germline de novo variants in the human genome,
defined as variants present in children but absent in their parents. With advancements in
whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing, denovo-db consolidates data from extensive genetic
studies, including those on neurodevelopmental disorders, but is not restricted to specific
phenotypes. This database provides essential resources for researchers investigating variant
characteristics, mutability, and associated phenotypes.</p>

<h2>Display Convention and Configuration</h2>
<p>
The denovo-db track's mouseover tooltip provides the following information about the data:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Position:</b> Specifies the chromosomal range where the variant is located</li>
  <li><b>Variant:</b> Describes the specific genetic change at this location</li>
  <li><b>Primary Phenotype:</b> Indicates the primary phenotype associated with the sample</li>
  <li><b>Validation:</b> Specifies the validation status of the variant</li>
</ul>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>
The denovo-db was assembled by integrating published literature on de novo variants identified
through large-scale whole-exome and whole-genome studies. Variants in the database are annotated
with relevant genetic information, including functional scores like CADD and validation status,
ensuring utility for genetic research. As of version 1.6, the database includes data from the
Simons Simplex Collection (SSC), with usage restrictions detailed on the denovo-db's
