<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
AbSplice is a method that predicts aberrant splicing across human tissues, as described in Wagner, 
&Ccedil;elik et al., 2023. This track displays precomputed AbSplice scores for all possible
single-nucleotide variants genome-wide. The scores represent the probability that a given variant
causes aberrant splicing in a given tissue.
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/gagneurlab/absplice/tree/master">AbSplice</a> scores
can be computed from VCF files and are based on quantitative tissue-specific splice site annotations
(<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/gagneurlab/splicemap">SpliceMaps</a>).
While SpliceMaps can be generated for any tissue of interest from a cohort of RNA-seq samples, this 
track includes 49 tissues available from the 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.gtexportal.org/home/samplingSitePage">Genotype-Tissue
Expression (GTEx) dataset</a>. 
</p>

<h2>Display Conventions</h2>
<p>
The AbSplice score is a probability estimate of how likely aberrant splicing of some sort takes 
place in a given tissue. The authors <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/gagneurlab/absplice?tab=readme-ov-file#output"
>suggest</a> three cutoffs which are represented by color in the track.
</p>

<ul>
<li><b><font color="#FF0000">High (red)</font></b> - <b>
  An AbSplice score over 0.2</b> indicates a high likelihood of aberrant splicing in at least one tissue.</li>
<li><b><font color="#FF8000">Medium (orange)</font></b> - <b>
  A score between 0.05 and 0.2 </b> indicates a medium likelihood.</li>
<li><b><font color="#0000FF">Low (blue)</font></b> - <b>
  A score between 0.01 and 0.05 </b> indicates a low likelihood.</li>
<li><b>Scores below 0.01 are not displayed.</b></li>
</ul>

Mouseover on items shows the gene name, maximum score, and tissues that had this score. Clicking on
any item brings up a table with scores for all 49 GTEX tissues.

<p>Precomputed AbSplice-DNA scores in all 49 GTEx tissues are available at

Zenodo</a>. 

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
Data was converted from the files (AbSplice_DNA_ $db _snvs_high_scores.zip) provided by the authors
at <a href="https://zenodo.org/search?q=AbSplice-DNA&l=list&p=1&s=10&sort=bestmatch"
target="_blank">zenodo.org</a>. Files in the
score_cutoff=0.01 directory were concatenated. To convert the data to bigBed format, scores and
their tissues were selected from the AbSplice_DNA fields and maximum scores, and then calculated
using a custom Python script, which can be found in the
<a a target="_blank"  href="https://github.com/ucscGenomeBrowser/kent/tree/master/src/hg/makeDb/outside/abSplice/">
makeDoc</a> from our GitHub repository.</p>
