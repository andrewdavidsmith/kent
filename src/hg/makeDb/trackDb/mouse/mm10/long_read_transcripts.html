  This collection is for long-read RNA-seq transcript models and primary data
  generate from experiments using third-generation sequencing technology
  (PabBio and Oxford Nanopore).  The initial set is long-read models from
  ENCODE4 PacBio Iso-Seq experiments.  More data set will be added to this
  collection in the future.
