<H2>Description</H2>
<p>
The FANTOM5 track shows mapped transcription start sites (TSS) and their usage in primary cells,
cell lines, and tissues to produce a comprehensive overview of gene expression across the human
body by using single molecule sequencing.
</p>

<h2> Display Conventions and Configuration </h2>

<p> Items in this track are colored according to their strand orientation. <b><font color=blue>Blue
indicates alignment to the negative strand</font></b>, and <b><font color=red>red indicates
alignment to the positive strand</font></b>.
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<h4>Protocol </h4>
<p> Individual biological states are profiled by HeliScopeCAGE, which is a variation of the CAGE
(Cap Analysis Gene Expression) protocol based on a single molecule sequencer. The standard protocol
requiring 5 &micro;g of total RNA as a starting material is referred to as <b>hCAGE</b>, and an
optimized version for a lower quantity (~ 100 ng) is referred to as <b>LQhCAGE</b> (Kanamori-Katyama
et al. 2011).

<li>hCAGE</li>
<li>LQhCAGE</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h4>Samples</h4>
<p>Transcription start sites (TSSs) were mapped and their usage in human, mouse, dog, rat, macaque
and chicken primary cells, cell lines, and tissues was to produce a comprehensive overview of
mammalian gene expression across the human body. 5&prime;-end of the mapped CAGE reads are counted
at a single base pair resolution (CTSS, CAGE tag starting sites) on the genomic coordinates, which
represent TSS activities in the sample. Individual samples shown in "TSS activity" tracks are
grouped as below.
<ul>
<li>Primary cell</li>
<li>Tissue</li>
<li>Cell Line</li>
<li>Time course</li>
<li>Fractionation</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h4>TSS peaks and enhancers</h4>
<p>TSS (CAGE) peaks across the panel of the biological states (samples) are identified by DPI
(decomposition based peak identification, Forrest et al. 2014), where each of the peaks consists of
neighboring and related TSSs. The peaks are used as anchors to define promoters and units of
promoter-level expression analysis. Two subsets of the peaks are defined based on evidence of read
counts, depending on scopes of subsequent analyses, and the first subset (referred as a
<b>robust set</b> of the peaks, thresholded for expression analysis is shown as TSS peaks. The
summary tracks consist of the TSS (CAGE) peaks, the enhancers, and summary profiles of TSS
activities (total and maximum values). The summary track consists of the following tracks.
<ul>
<li> TSS (CAGE) peaks
<ul>
  <li> the robust peaks </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> TSS summary profiles
<ul>
<li> Total counts and TPM (tags per million) in all the samples </li>
<li> Maximum counts and TPM among the samples </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>TSS activity</h4>
<p>
5&prime;-end of the mapped CAGE reads are counted at a single base pair resolution (CTSS, CAGE tag starting sites) on the genomic coordinates, which represent TSS activities in the sample. The read counts tracks indicate raw counts of CAGE reads, and the TPM tracks indicate normalized counts as TPM (tags per million).

<h2>Data Access</h2>
<p>
FANTOM5 data can be explored interactively with the
<a href="../cgi-bin/hgTables">Table Browser</a> and cross-referenced with the 
<a href="../cgi-bin/hgIntegrator">Data Integrator</a>. For programmatic access,
the track can be accessed using the Genome Browser&apos;s
<a href="../../goldenPath/help/api.html">REST API</a>.
ReMap annotations can be downloaded from the
<a href="https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/$db/reMap">Genome Browser's download server</a>
as a bigBed file. This compressed binary format can be remotely queried through
command line utilities. Please note that some of the download files can be quite large.</p>
