Installation overview for Cell Data Warehouse (CDW).

1) First bring up a recent linux distribution.
2) Run a Genome Browser Install script that should include mysql/mariaDb install.
3) Add in (with dnf install) libpng-devel, libuuid-devel, mariadb-devel, nodejs
4) Create a cdw user at the Unix level that will be the one to run the daemons.
5) Create the following directories and make them writable and executable by
   the cdw user.
   	$HOME/cdw/bin/scripts
	$HOME/cdw/bin/x86_64
	/data/cirm
	/usr/local/apache/cgi-bin-cdw
6) Log in as the cdw user
7) Get the Kent UCSC source and execute the following makes from the 
   src directory:
       cd ~/kent/src
       make -j 16 libs
       cd ~/kent/src/hg/cirm/cdw
       make -j 16
       cd ~/kent/src/hg/hgsql
       make
       cd ~/kent/src/hg/encode3/encodeDataWarehouse/utils/edwSamPairedEndStats
       make
       cd ~/kent/src/hg/encode3/encodeDataWarehouse/utils/edwBamStats
       make
       cd ~/kent/src/hg/encode3/encodeDataWarehouse/utils/edwSamRepeatAnalysis
       make
8) Make up a configuration file for accessing the database in ~/.hg.conf
    with the following six lines:
       db.host=localhost
       db.user=cdw
       db.password=
       cdw.host=localhost
       cdw.user=cdw
       cdw.password=
    where you get the password values from the system admins or Jim.
    (The db.password and cdw.password can be the same.)
    Do
       chmod 600 .hg.conf
    to make it private
9) Create a cdw user for the mariaSql database and also a cdw database that
   the cdw user has full authorities for.
10) Copy over the validation data from hgwdev
       cd /data/cirm
       scp -rp hgwdev:/data/cirm/valData .
11) Create the table structure for the cdw database by logging into mysql,
    doing
       hgsqladmin create cdw
       hgsql cdw < ~/kent/src/hg/cirm/cdw/lib/cdw.sql;
12) Populate the settings table by doing
       insert into cdwSettings set name='prefix',val='SSPG';
       insert into cdwSettings set name='schema',val='/data/cirm/valData/tags.schema';
    Note these lines control the prefix to the accession numbers for the files,
    and the tagStorm schema respectively.
13) Set up users for cdw system, people who can submit files:
        cdwCreateUser kent@soe.ucsc.edu
        hgsql -e "update cdwUser set isAdmin=1 where email='kent@soe.ucsc.edu'" cdw
	cdwCreateUser mhaeussl@ucsc.edu
	cdwCreateUser wisulliv@ucsc.edu
14) Run script to load up validations:
        ~/kent/src/hg/cirm/cdw/initQa
15) Start up the daemons
	cd /data/cirm/cdw
	cdwRunDaemon cdw cdwJob 5 -log=cdwJob.log
    Sometimes the daemons will crash out.  Usually it's on a new data type. Do a
        ps -u cdw
    to see if this has happened.  If so then do
        killall cdwRunDaemon
    have a look at the cdwJob.log,  and possibly the latest entries in the cdwJob
    database table, and then do cdwRunDaemon again as above to restart.
